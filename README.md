The PandaSaurus Studio is a team of 10 developers and designers.
Our goal was to produce a 2D game with content and design that appeals to players of all ages, following the theme of "non-violent". We demonstrated skills in implementing game mechanics using C# and Unity Engine, creating game assets and managing the project process on DevOps following Agile Methodology.
